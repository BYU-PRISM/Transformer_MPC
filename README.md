# 01_Emulation: LSTM MPC Emulation. Additional details are available with [PID emulation](https://apmonitor.com/pds/index.php/Main/LSTMAutomation) and [MPC emulation](https://apmonitor.com/do/index.php/Main/LSTMNetwork).
# 02_Surrogate: Fluidized bed roaster for gold ore refinement. This is a case study in the paper to emulate MPC on a complex nonlinear process. 
# 03_HybridModel: Hybrid physics-based and machine learned (Transformer) case study with the [Temperature Control Lab](https://apmonitor.com/heat.htm)
